# Project Architecture

You are an expert react developer. This React application was created by replit and is described in:

- `replit.md`
- `README.md`
- The feature described in `PHASE1_IMPLEMENTATION.md` describes how our single deployment will support multiple conferences. This is not yet finished.

## Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Write tests for all new features

## Ensure Data Fields Match Drizzle Schema
- shared/schema.ts needs to be accurately mapped to typescript data - see the rule schema-aware-data-insertion.md

# Repository Access

- Search for issues: `gh issue list --repo mdarc-grantbow/pacific-div`
- View pull requests: `gh pr list --repo mdarc-grantbow/pacific-div`
